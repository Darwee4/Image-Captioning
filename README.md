# Image Captioning with Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements an advanced image captioning system using deep learning techniques. The model combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for caption generation.

## Features
- Utilizes InceptionV3 as the CNN backbone for image feature extraction
- Implements attention-based LSTM for sequence generation
- Supports training on custom datasets
- Includes comprehensive error handling and validation
- Produces human-readable captions for input images

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Numpy
- NLTK (for BLEU score evaluation)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/image-captioning.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset with images and corresponding captions
2. Train the model:
```python
from image_captioning import ImageCaptioningModel

model = ImageCaptioningModel()
model.train('path/to/images', 'path/to/captions.txt')
```
3. Generate captions:
```python
caption = model.generate_caption('path/to/image.jpg')
print(caption)
```

## Model Architecture
The model consists of two main components:
1. **CNN Encoder**: Extracts visual features using InceptionV3
2. **LSTM Decoder**: Generates captions using attention mechanism
